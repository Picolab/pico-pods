# pico-pods
Linking picos to Solid pods

*Goal:* The goal of this project is to combine picos and Solid pods to support creating decentralized applications or dApps. dApps give people control over their apps and the data in them.
This project will make it possible for a developer to instantiate picos that have an associated Solid pod and then use the pod from within KRL programs to store data. Using the pico API, Javascript-based applications can be created that have no identity, hosting, or data storage infrastructure.
